## Description

An api demo for the awesome ZÃ© Delivery engineering team \o/

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running and deploying the app

```
docker-compose up
```

You can access the api at the [Api Endpoint](http://localhost:3000/pos)

If you want to deploy it to an AWS ECS Cluster, please refer to the following docs: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cmd-ecs-cli-compose.html

## Test

This project was setup to work with docker, so in order for the tests to work,
the docker container with the postgis (https://hub.docker.com/r/kartoza/postgis/) instance must be running, so lets 
go step by step on how to make the tests run correctly.

__1__ - Make sure the docker container for both the app and the database is running:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

__2__ - After the containers are up and running, change the `ormconfig.json` file contents
to this:
```json
{
  "type": "postgres",
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 25432,
  "username": "root",
  "password": "root",
  "database": "test",
  "entities": ["dist/**/*.entity{.ts,.js}"],
  "synchronize": true
}
```

> ___*Samples have been provided at the ormconfig.sample.txt file.*___

__3-__ At this point you can run the tests without any problems

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
